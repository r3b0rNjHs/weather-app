Tmc2 Backend code challenge

## Getting Started

This project is based on Flask with a swagger that runs on a python3 docker image.


## Installation

Inside of the root of the project, enter into the terminal: 'make start'

This will run the server on http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Internal Testing

There are two approachs:

- For fast developing enter into the terminal: 'make shell',
This will initialize the bash where you can run the suitcase tests with 'mamba test' and can scope into concrete test folders and contexts adding the folder path.

- For easy-going testing the project: 'make test'
